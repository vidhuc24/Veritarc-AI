This negligence can lead to unauthorized access and misuse of the system. Immediate action is required to rectify this issue.\n\n        2. **Access Levels**: Some roles have been assigned inappropriate access levels. Specifically, the Lead Software Engineer (PF001) and the DevOps Engineer (PF011) have Admin access, which is not required for their roles. This could lead to a potential breach of data.\n\n        3. **Last Login Date**: There are some employees whose last login dates are close to the end of the review period. This could indicate that access reviews are not being conducted regularly.\n\n        **Recommendations**: Initiate a comprehensive review of the access rights assigned to employees. Ensure that all roles have the appropriate access levels and that managerial approval is obtained for any changes. Regularly monitor login activity to detect any anomalies.\n\n        ---\n        \n        **REVIEW COMPLETION STATUS**\n        \n        **Failed**: The review identified several critical issues that need to be addressed.
