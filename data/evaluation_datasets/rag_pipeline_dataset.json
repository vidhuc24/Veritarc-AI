Immediate action is required to rectify this issue.\n\n        2. **Access Levels**: Some roles have been assigned inappropriate access levels. Specifically, the Lead Software Engineer (PF001) and the DevOps Engineer (PF011) have Admin access, which is not required for their roles. This could lead to a potential breach of data.\n\n        3. **Last Login Date**: There are some employees whose last login dates are close to the end of the review period.

Business Justification for the Change:\nThe current payment processing system, PayFlow v1.2, has been experiencing intermittent downtime, impacting our fintech operations and customer experience. The proposed change is to upgrade to PayFlow v2.0, which offers enhanced stability and improved performance.\n\n2. Technical Details and Impact Assessment:\nThe upgrade to PayFlow v2.0 involves updating the system software, database schema, and integrating new APIs. The change will impact the payment processing module and related subsystems, including the transaction logging and reporting modules. The downtime during the upgrade is expected to be minimal (1-2 hours) during off-peak hours.\n\n3. Testing Plan and Results:\nA comprehensive testing plan has been developed, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. The testing will be performed in a staging environment that mirrors the production environment. The test results will be documented and reviewed by the Quality Assurance team.\n\n4. Security Review Status:\nA preliminary security review has been conducted by the Information Security team. The new version complies with our internal security policies and standards. A final security sign-off is pending upon completion of penetration testing.\n\n5. Rollback Procedures:\nIn case of any critical issues during or after the upgrade, a rollback plan has been prepared. The plan includes restoring the system to its current state using the latest backup and reverting any changes made to the database.\n\n6. Approval Signatures and Timestamps:\n- Technical Approval: Ryan Park (DevOps Engineer) - [Timestamp]\n- Business Approval: [Pending Angela Foster's signature and timestamp]\n\n7. Implementation Schedule:\nThe proposed date for the upgrade is October 15, 2024, during off-peak hours (2:00 AM - 4:00 AM). The rollback plan will be in place until October 22, 2024, to ensure any issues can be quickly addressed.\n\nPlease review and provide your approval for the proposed change.\n\n[Signature Field for Angela Foster]\n\nNote: This change request form is compliant with SOX-ITGC-CM-01 - Change Management - Change Request & Approval Process, with minor compliance gaps.
