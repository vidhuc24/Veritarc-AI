The downtime during the upgrade is expected to be minimal (1-2 hours) during off-peak hours.\n\n3. Testing Plan and Results:\nA comprehensive testing plan has been developed, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. The testing will be performed in a staging environment that mirrors the production environment. The test results will be documented and reviewed by the Quality Assurance team.\n\n4. Security Review Status:\nA preliminary security review has been conducted by the Information Security team. The new version complies with our internal security policies and standards. A final security sign-off is pending upon completion of penetration testing.\n\n5. Rollback Procedures:\nIn case of any critical issues during or after the upgrade, a rollback plan has been prepared. The plan includes restoring the system to its current state using the latest backup and reverting any changes made to the database.\n\n6.
