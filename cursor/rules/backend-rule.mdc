# Veritarc AI - Backend Rules

## Deployment & Environment
- Backend should be deployable to cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Must be testable locally with clear setup instructions
- Use environment variables for all configuration
- Include health check endpoints for monitoring

## FastAPI & API Design
- Use FastAPI dependency injection
- Implement proper error responses with HTTP status codes
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Include comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use async/await for external API calls

## LangChain/LangGraph Patterns
- Use LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) for chain composition
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Use structured outputs with Pydantic models
- Implement proper state management in LangGraph agents
- Use LangSmith tracing for debugging

## AI & LLM Specific Guidelines
- Use structured outputs with Pydantic models
- Implement proper prompt engineering techniques
- Consider token limits and costs
- Use appropriate chunking strategies for documents
- Implement proper memory management for agents

## File Processing
- Support multiple formats: PDF, DOCX, images (PNG, JPG)
- Implement proper error handling for corrupted files
- Use streaming for large file uploads
- Include file size and type validation

## Multi-Agent Architecture
- Use LangGraph for complex workflows
- Focus on semantic search and retrieval accuracy
- Implement proper state management in LangGraph agents
- Consider evaluation-driven improvements with RAGAS metrics

## Backend Development Guidelines
When working on backend components:
1. **RAG Implementation**: Focus on semantic search and retrieval accuracy
2. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Use LangGraph for complex workflows
3. **Evaluation-Driven**: Always consider RAGAS metrics for improvements
4. **Performance**: Consider scalability and response time requirements
5. **Security**: Handle sensitive audit data with proper security measures
