**EVIDENCE EVALUATION:**

**Document Type:** {item['evidence_metadata']['document_type'].replace('_', ' ').title()}
**Control Focus:** {control_id} requirements
**Company:** {item['evidence_metadata']['company']}

**SPECIFIC FINDINGS FROM EVIDENCE:**

1. **Documentation Quality:** The evidence shows proper structured documentation with clear sections, dates, and identification information.

2. **Approval Processes:** The document contains appropriate approval signatures and management oversight as evidenced by the approval section.

3. **Compliance Elements:** Key compliance requirements are addressed through:
   - Proper identification and categorization of items
   - Documented review processes and findings
   - Management approval and sign-off
   - Retention of supporting documentation

4. **Evidence-Specific Analysis:**
{_analyze_evidence_content(evidence_content, control_id)}

**COMPLIANCE DETERMINATION:** PASS

**Rationale:** The evidence demonstrates adequate compliance with {control_id} requirements. The documentation is complete, properly approved, and addresses the key control objectives. While there may be minor areas for improvement, the core requirements are satisfied.

**Supporting Context:** The retrieved control contexts confirm this assessment aligns with the specified requirements for {control_id.split('-')[-1].replace('_', ' ').title()} controls."""

**Control Focus:** {control_id} requirements
**Company:** {item['evidence_metadata']['company']}

**SPECIFIC DEFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED:**

1. **Documentation Gaps:** The evidence shows critical missing elements required for {control_id} compliance.

2. **Process Deficiencies:** Key process requirements are not adequately demonstrated:
   - Missing or inadequate approval workflows
   - Insufficient documentation of review processes
   - Lack of proper oversight mechanisms

3. **Compliance Failures:**
{_analyze_evidence_failures(evidence_content, control_id)}

4. **Risk Assessment:** These deficiencies create significant compliance risks and fail to meet the minimum standards for {control_id}.

**COMPLIANCE DETERMINATION:** FAIL

**Rationale:** The evidence does not demonstrate adequate compliance with {control_id} requirements. Critical control objectives are not met, and significant deficiencies exist that compromise the effectiveness of the control.

**Recommendations:** Immediate remediation required to address identified deficiencies and ensure proper compliance with {control_id} requirements."""
